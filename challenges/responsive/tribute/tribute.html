                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>Baden-Powell was born as Robert Stephenson Smyth Powell at 6 Stanhope Street (now 11 Stanhope Terrace), Paddington, London, on 22 February 1857. He was called Stephe (pronounced "Stevie") by his family.[11] He was named after his godfather, Robert Stephenson, the railway and civil engineer,[12] and his third name was his mother's maiden name.[13]</p>
                <p>Baden-Powell was a son of The Reverend Baden Powell, Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford University and Church of England priest and his third wife, Henrietta Grace Smyth (3 September 1824 – 13 October 1914), eldest daughter of Admiral William Henry Smyth. After Powell died in 1860, to identify her children with her late husband's fame, and to set her own children apart from their half-siblings and cousins, his mother styled the family name Baden-Powell. The name was eventually legally changed by Royal Licence on 30 April 1902.</p>
                <p>Baden-Powell attended Rose Hill School, Tunbridge Wells. He was given a scholarship to Charterhouse, a prestigious public school. He played the piano and violin, was an ambidextrous artist, and enjoyed acting. Holidays were spent on yachting or canoeing expeditions with his brothers. His first introduction to Scouting skills was through stalking and cooking game while avoiding teachers in the nearby woods, which were strictly out-of-bounds</p>
            
                <h2>Military Career</h2>
                <p>Baden-Powell was the garrison commander during the subsequent Siege of Mafeking, which lasted 217 days. Although Baden-Powell could have destroyed his stores and had sufficient forces to break out throughout much of the siege, especially since the Boers lacked adequate artillery to shell the town or its forces, he remained in the town to the point of his intended mounted soldiers eating their horses. </p>
                <p>The siege was lifted on 16 May 1900. Baden-Powell was promoted to major-general, and became a national hero.[30] However, the British military commanders were more critical of his performance and even less impressed with his subsequent choices to again allow himself to be besieged.[26][29] Ultimately, his failure to properly understand the situation and abandonment of the soldiers, mostly Australians and Rhodesians, at the Battle of Elands River led to his being removed from action.[25][26]</p>
                <p>In 1910, after being rebuked for a series of what were regarded as publicity gaffes, one suggesting invasion by Germany, Baden-Powell retired from the Army.[11] Baden-Powell later claimed[dubious – discuss] he was advised by King Edward VII that he could better serve his country by promoting Scouting.[34][35]</p>
                
                <h2>Scouting</h2>
                <p>En 1901, tras la liberación de Mafeking, Baden-Powell fue ascendido a mayor General por la Reina. Como héroe de adultos y jóvenes que había regresado de África a Inglaterra, se encontró con la sorpresa que su popularidad personal se había extendido gracias a su libro Aids to Scouting (Ayudas para el Escultismo), destinado al ejército, y que estaba siendo usado como libro de texto en las escuelas para muchachos. </p>
                <p>siendo usado como libro de texto en las escuelas para muchachos. Dado que un libro destinado a adultos había atraído a jóvenes, se puso a trabajar recopilando sus experiencias en la India y en África entre los zulúes y otras tribus, con el fin de escribir un libro dirigido directamente a la juventud británica. Recopiló textos que le permitieron estudiar acerca de la educación de jóvenes a través de la historia.28​ </p>
                <p>Del 1 al 9 de agosto de 1907, se realizó el primer campamento scout, en la isla de Brownsea, en la Bahía de Poole, Dorset.29​ </p>
